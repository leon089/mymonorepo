### ðŸš€ **Setting Up a Monorepo for `name-extractor` with a New Service**

We'll convert your current project into a **monorepo structure** and add another service, e.g., `data-processor`. We'll manage both using **Poetry**.

---

### âœ… **1. Monorepo Structure**

```bash
monorepo/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ name-extractor/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ name_extractor/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ poetry.lock
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data-processor/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ data_processor/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ processor.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_processor.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml  # Root project config
â”œâ”€â”€ poetry.lock
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

---

### âœ… **2. Move `name-extractor` to `services/`**

```bash
mkdir -p monorepo/services
mv name_extractor monorepo/services/name-extractor
cd monorepo/services/name-extractor
```

---

### âœ… **3. Add the New Service: `data-processor`**

```bash
cd monorepo/services
poetry new data-processor
```

This creates:

```
data-processor/
â”œâ”€â”€ data_processor/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
```

---

### âœ… **4. Root `pyproject.toml` for Monorepo**

Create `monorepo/pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "monorepo-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Monorepo for name-extractor and data-processor"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
black = "^23.1.0"
flake8 = "^6.0.0"
mypy = "^1.1.1"
isort = "^5.12.0"
pre-commit = "^4.1.0"

[tool.poetry.workspace]
packages = [
    { path = "services/name-extractor" },
    { path = "services/data-processor" }
]
```

---

### âœ… **5. Update Service `pyproject.toml` Files**

#### `services/name-extractor/pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "name-extractor"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Extract names from JSON and text files"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
```

#### `services/data-processor/pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "data-processor"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Service to process data"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.9"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
```

---

### âœ… **6. Install Dependencies for Both Services**

Run this from the monorepo root:

```bash
cd monorepo
poetry install
```

Poetry will install dependencies for both services.

---

### âœ… **7. Add a Simple Script to `data-processor`**

`services/data-processor/data_processor/processor.py`:

```python
def process(data):
    """Simple data processor."""
    return [item.upper() for item in data]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(process(sample_data))
```

Test it:

```bash
python services/data-processor/data_processor/processor.py
```

---

### âœ… **8. Test Setup**

Add a test for `data-processor`:

```python
# services/data-processor/tests/test_processor.py
from data_processor.processor import process

def test_process():
    assert process(["apple", "banana"]) == ["APPLE", "BANANA"]
```

Run tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

---

### âœ… **9. Shared Linting & Pre-commit Hook**

Move `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the root and update:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
    rev: 6.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
```

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

---

### ðŸš€ **10. Monorepo Build Script (`build.sh`)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "ðŸš€ Building Monorepo Services..."

# Linting
poetry run black services/
poetry run isort services/
poetry run flake8 services/

# Tests
poetry run pytest services/name-extractor/tests/
poetry run pytest services/data-processor/tests/

echo "âœ… Build Complete!"
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

---

### ðŸš€ **All Set!**

You now have:
- A **monorepo** structure with `name-extractor` and `data-processor`
- Shared dependencies managed via **Poetry**
- A unified build and test process

Let me know if you'd like to add more features! ðŸš€
